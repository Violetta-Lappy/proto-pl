# Introduction

## The CPLXENDC Manifesto - 12 Rule
CPLXENDC has a manifesto that it must obey no matter what:
- It just work (must be tested after 10 main release before into public)
- Portablity (IMPORTANT - NO MATTER WHAT)
- Easy to Compile (IMPORTANT - NO MATTER WHAT)
- Easy to transistion from C# to CPLXENDC (but with some feature of C++)
- Native Class Library that help coding a breeze (BUT NO BLOATED NO MATTER WHAT)
- NO BLOATED, user must implemented features themself
- Work only for Windows, Linux, and Web (other platform is optional, but not main focus)
- Each module is modular, will not included if programmer not want to, must not BLOATED in any means
- Offline Software Compatible Only

Final Rule:
- The Organization only do neccessary native stuff, so ANY REQUEST that seemed BLOATED will be ignored
- This is programmer oriented, meaning programmer develop their own solution of their necessary feature (Savegame)

## Programming Paradirm
- Object Oriented
- Procedural Programming
- Data Oriented
- Math

## Inspiration
CPLXENDC (Alternate Name: CPLX-ENDC) is a programming language inspire by the following language:
- C99
- C++
- C# (Main Influence, Syntax Style)
- Rust
- Flutter Dart (Main Influence, Syntax Style)
- JavaScript & Node.js (Only the feature, not syntax style)
- Lua (Only the feature, not syntax style)
- Python (Only the feature, not syntax style)
- Holy C (Why not :]])

## CPLXENDC Framework
CPLXENDC Framework will use CPLX-ENDC to give user a full experience like Flutter, only do best at this following:
- Editor (Emacs, VSCode, CustomDIY IDE Editor)
- Embeded Language (Use in Blender and others)
- Application Gui Development 
  - Retained 
  - Immediate Mode
  - Flutter Web Style
- AI (Machine Learning & LLM - Large Language Model)

CPLXENDC is best at these only in my lifetime and legacy:
- Game Programming
- Audio Plugin Programming
- Embedded Language Support (Blender, Shotcut, Photoshop)
- Simple Application Software
- AI Chat GPT & Machine Learning & Web Scraping & Automation
- Game Design Automation
